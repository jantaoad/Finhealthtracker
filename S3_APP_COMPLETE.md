## 🔮 Future: Add Real Backend

When ready to deploy backend:

1. Deploy backend to Railway/Render
2. Get backend URL
3. Edit: `frontend/.env.production`
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url/api
   ```
4. In `api.js` change:
   ```javascript
   const USE_MOCK_API = false
   ```
5. Rebuild: `npm run build`
6. Upload to S3

Switches from mock data to real database!
